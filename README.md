Ongoing researches, literatures, press release and lab data

Nature brings us some species be able to suspend their life still under deep frozen state，such as Water Bears, Tardigrade. This bio-chemical process originating from Cambrian age is preserved today to show us a potential channel to extend life eternal.  
We collect and put knowledge documents in this respository for study.

Part I: Learn from nature

  Studies by protective functions: 

    1. Desiccation tolerance

      - Tardigrade‘s intrinsically disordered proteins (TDPs): TDPs upregulated upon desiccation DOI:https://doi.org/10.1016/j.molcel.2017.02.018： “TDPs are highly hydrophilic, abundantly expressed, and essential as well as sufficient for desiccation tolerance. ”
      - heat shock proteins (HSPs):Antarctic midge, fish and ciliate

    2.1 Freeze avoidance - lower the blood's freezing point
    2.2 Freeze tolerance - survive freezing

      - Anti-freeze Sugar: trehalose, glucose
      - Anti-freeze Protein: AFPs in fish, insect 
      - Other natural cryoprotectants: glycerol, urea

     3. Reduce metabolism
     
      - Hibernation
        - Anti-oxidants
      
      - Tun state: Tardigrades
     
    

  Studies by species:

    1. Water bear/ Tardigrade: TDPs

    2. Wood frog: 
      - AFPs 
      - trehalose
      - freeze tolerance HC-3 gene w/ ortholog called Aquaporin 3, or AQP3, in the human genome
    
    3. Beetle/ Alaskan Upis ceramboides: AFPs
    
   
   
Part II: Freezing and Rewarming Technologies

  1. Nanowarming

    - Magnetic/ iron oxide nanoparticles embedded in cryoprotectants (CPA) solutions
    - vitrification state
